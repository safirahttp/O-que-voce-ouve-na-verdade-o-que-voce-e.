      <br>
        <p> Time shakes, found you at the water </p>
        <p> At first you were my father </p>
        <p> Now I love you like a brother </p>
        <p> Earthquakes shake the dust behind you </p>
        <p> This world, at times will blind you </p>
        <p> Still, I know I'll see you there </p>
        <br>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <p> Come on, come on, come on </p>
        <p> Things aren't always what they seem to be </p>
        <p> Come on, come on, come on </p>
        <p> Do you understand the things that you've been seein'? </p>
        <p> Come on, come on, come on </p>
        <p> Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'? </p>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <br>
        <p> Heartbreaks, the heavy world's upon your shoulders </p>
        <p> Will we burn on or just smolder? </p>
        <p> Somehow, I know I'll find you there </p>
        <p> Ooh, you wanna see if you can change it </p>
        <p> Change it </p>
        <p> Still, I know I'll see you there </p>
        <br>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <p> Come on, come on, come on </p>
        <p> Things aren't always what they seem to be </p>
        <p> Do you understand the things that you've been seein'? </p>
        <p> Come on, come on, come on </p>
        <p> Do you understand the things that you've been dreamin'? </p>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <br>
        <p> Ten thousand people stand alone now </p>
        <p> And in the evening, the sun sank </p>
        <p> Tomorrow it will rise </p>
        <p> Time flies by </p>
        <p> They all sang along </p>
        <p> Time flies by </p>
        <p> They all sang along </p>
        <p> Time flies by </p>
        <p> They all sang along </p>
        <p> Time flies by, by </p>
        <br>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <p> Come on, come on, come on </p>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
        <p> Come a little closer, then you'll see </p>
